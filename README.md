Project Description:
The Loan Approval Prediction System is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the approval of loan applications. This system helps financial institutions automate and streamline the loan approval process by accurately assessing the eligibility of applicants based on various features.

Key Contributions:
Implemented Machine Learning Models: Developed and trained several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Feature Scaling and Selection: Applied feature scaling and selection techniques to optimize model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilized GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the models.
Model Selection: Despite the SVM model achieving the highest accuracy, the Random Forest Classifier was chosen for its robustness and balance between performance and interpretability.

Technologies and Tools:
Python: Used for implementing and training machine learning models.
Scikit-learn: Employed for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
Pandas and NumPy: Utilized for data manipulation, analysis, and preprocessing.
Flask: Developed the backend of the application using Flask.
